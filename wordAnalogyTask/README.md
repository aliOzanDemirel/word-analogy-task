Utilizing Word Analogy Task to Determine and Construct Semantic Relations
Current methods for determining semantic relations between words mostly are being done manually.
Our project's objective is to use word analogy task on the local embedding of words to automatically
detect semantic relationships. In our experimental setup, we'll utilize a textual corpus along with
its semantically annotated version to serve as a ground-truth. After accomplishing this task, we can
minimize human efforts of identifying and labeling semantic relations through provided automatic support.
