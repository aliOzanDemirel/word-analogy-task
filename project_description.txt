Utilizing Word Analogy Task to Determine and Construct Semantic Relations

Current methods for determining semantic relations between words mostly are being done manually. Our project's objective is to use word analogy task on the local embedding of words to automatically detect semantic relationships. In our experimental setup, we'll utilize a textual corpus along with its semantically annotated version to serve as a ground-truth. After accomplishing this task, we can minimize human efforts of identifying and labeling semantic relations through provided automatic support.
